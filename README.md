# MonopolySim

## Description
Python-based program created to model the probability of a player landing on certain properties/tiles using standard Monopoly rules. The user is able to input a certain number of turns and change certain rules to more accurately represent house rules to find which properties have been landed on the most in those turns.

## Dependencies
* Python >= 2.6.0
* Mac/Windows OS

## Future Changes
Will implement a full front end framework to have a visual for a player moving around the Monopoly board and showing stats in real time as well as a graph to displays the overall statistics on the side
